  Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a DevSecOps Engineer specializing in cloud native technologies and secure software delivery. I focus on Kubernetes, containerization, and platform engineering, with plenty of experience experience across AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud platforms.

  I'm passionate about Infrastructure as Code, GitOps practices, and building secure, scalable cloud native solutions. I work extensively with tools like Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes, while maintaining a strong foundation in Linux systems and automation.

  I am a DevSecOps Engineer at [Defense Unicorns](https://defenseunicorns.com/), where I architect and implement cloud native solutions through their Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) platform. I work closely with Mission Heroes to enable secure software delivery pipelines. I specialize in containerized applications and implementing DevSecOps practices in highly regulated environments.

  I serve as a Cyber Warfare Technician (170A) in the Army National Guard, where I leverage my technical expertise to support cyber operations and defense initiatives.

  When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing with my dog, and working on personal projects.

  I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative cloud native projects and explore new technologies in the DevSecOps space. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.

  This online resume was generated with the help of the [Modern Resume Theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme) for Jekyll. It's hosted on GitHub Pages. You can check out my source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/binbashburns/binbashburns.com)!
