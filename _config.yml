  Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a Cloud Engineer with a passion for automation, Infrastructure as Code, and DevSecOps. I have experience with AWS, Azure, and GCP, and I'm always looking to learn more. 

  I like Terraform, Ansible, and Linux, and I'm always looking for new ways to automate tasks and improve efficiency. I'm also a big fan of GitLab, and I've used it to build CI/CD pipelines, manage infrastructure, and host websites.
  
  I'm currently working at [Coalfire](https://coalfire.com/) as a Cloud Engineer, where I'm responsible for the design and implementation of cloud infrastructure for our clients. I'm the maintainer of [SoldierSave.com](https://soldiersave.com/), which is a GitLab-hosted website that provides resources for military veterans. You can view it's source code [here](https://gitlab.com/binbashburns/army-benefits-unofficial-pages/).

  I'm also an Information Technology Specialist (25B) for the Army National Guard. I am attending Warrant Officer Candidate School to become a Cyber Warfare Technician (170A).

  When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing with my dog, and working on personal projects.

  I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team, please don't hesitate to reach out.
